	* .gitignore: Add lib64 - a virtualenv artifact.

	* buildout.cfg (eggs-directory): Obviate sharing egggs by
	requiring local eggs-directory and download-cache directories.

	(auto-checkout, eggs, test-eggs): Comment out references to
	ploneconf.site and ploneconf.site_sneak eggs. Their presence will
	cause an error until we bootstrap the addon with Mr. Bob.
